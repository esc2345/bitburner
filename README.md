| directory | comments |
| --------- | -------- |
| scripts/ | scripts to deploy on hacked servers |
| temp/ | temporary files created and read by scripts |
| utils/ | code used by other script files |

steps:
1. get list of servers (workers) for running weaken/grow/hack scripts
2. weaken target to min security (batch of weaken)
3. grow target to max $ (batches of grow/weaken)
4. keep running hack/grow/weaken against target (batch of hack/grow/weaken)

notes:
* reload list of servers when the number or servers changes
* retain batches when closing/loading game
* separate JSON and execute script instance for each target

scripts / classes:
* batch (type, target, array of tasks & threads)
* portnumbers (ports used to coordinate across scripts)
  * number of rooted servers
* filenames (static variables for filenames)
* schedule (creates array of batches, saves to file, calls execute on file)
  * weaken target
  * grow target
  * hack target
* execute (runs batches and tasks)
